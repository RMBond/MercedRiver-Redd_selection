General Goals
-------------

The main goal is to preform a logistic regression invesigating redd presence (redd=1) and absence (redd=0). Potential parameters include depth, velocity, csi, wsg, dar, and site (Merced River Ranch (mrr) and Robinson Reach (rr)). The steps include generating a candidate set of models, run AIC, and additional statistics as needed. This analysis is simmilar to Benjankar et al., (2016).

General Goals
-------------

The main goal is to perform a logistic regression investigating redd presence (redd=1) and absence (redd=0). Potential parameters include depth, velocity, csi, wsg, dar, and site (Merced River Ranch (mrr) and Robinson Reach (rr)). The steps include generating a candidate set of models, run AIC, and additional statistics as needed. This analysis is similar to Benjankar et al., (2016). The GIT repository can be found here <https://github.com/RMBond/Merced_Redd_selection.git>

**Description of Datasets:**
Logistic Regression input file **mHabVarsSite.csv** was generated by L. Harrison on 14 February 2019. The script **Redd\_logisticregression.R** was created to run the logistic regression analysis.

Interpolate a grainsize raster
------------------------------

Currently there are two grainsize datasets. DWR from 2012 and Sam Emerson's thesis pebble count data from 2015. The DWR data is summarized to one `D50` and one `D84` value for each cross section, while Emerson's data has pebble count in the outer, middle and inner positions of each bend.

The goal here is to recalculate a `D50` and `D84` for each position/bend combination. From there we will use ArcGIS to merge the two pebble count datasets into one point shapefile, then interpolate a TIN and DEM within the wetted channel.

Next To Do's
------------

1.  Other candidate models? Interactions?
2.  Additional statistics? (Wald statistic?)

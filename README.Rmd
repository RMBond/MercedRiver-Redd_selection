## General Goals

The main goal is to preform a logistic regression invesigating redd presence (redd=1) and absence (redd=0). Potential parameters include depth, velocity, csi, wsg, dar, and site (Merced River Ranch (mrr) and Robinson Reach (rr)). The steps include generating a candidate set of models, run AIC, and additional statistics as needed. This analysis is simmilar to Benjankar et al., (2016).

      
**Description of Datasets:**  
Logistic Regression input file **mHabVarsSite.csv** was generated by L. Harrison on 14 February 2019. 
The script **XXX** was created to run the logistic regression analysis.




## Next To Do's

1. Additional statistics? (Wald statistic?)

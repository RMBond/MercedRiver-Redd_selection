## General Goals

The main goal is to perform a logistic regression investigating redd presence (redd=1) and absence (redd=0). Potential parameters include depth, velocity, csi, wsg, dar, and site (Merced River Ranch (mrr) and Robinson Reach (rr)). The steps include generating a candidate set of models, run AIC, and additional statistics as needed. This analysis is similar to Benjankar et al., (2016). The GIT repository can be found here https://github.com/RMBond/Merced_Redd_selection.git

      
**Description of Datasets:**  
Logistic Regression input file **mHabVarsSite.csv** was generated by L. Harrison on 14 February 2019. 
The script **Redd_logisticregression.R** was created to run the logistic regression analysis.




## Next To Do's

1. Other candidate models? Interactions?
2. Additional statistics? (Wald statistic?)
